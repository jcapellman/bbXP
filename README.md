# bbXP

## History
This project technically started with the first web page I did back in 1996 on GeoCities.  However I consider the real-development to have begun in July 2003 when I decided to pickup PHP and MySQL before starting college up in Maryland.  From 2003 to 2005 it was under very active development and as my PHP and MySQL skills were so did the level of complexity and cleanliness of code.  In 2006 I started my first full-time programming job and they happen to be using Smarty Templates on the project I was working on which I immediately fell in love with and began updating the framework to utilize it to clean up my UI layer.  As fate would have Spring 2007 I switched to a different project that was largely ASP.NET 1.1 - which having not messed with yet I figured what better way to learn in my free time than port all of the PHP/MySQL code to ASP.NET 2.0/SQL Server.  The code in my personal SVN repo went through many variations until I finally moved to MVC and then onto ASP.NET Core earlier this year.

Started the revamp to a unified asp.net core 2.0 mvc/webapi projects along with a .net standard 2.0 library (for use later in new mobile apps).

### September 16, 2016
In doing Node.js, MongoDB and Redis deep dives over the last 2 weeks I have decided to add Node.js/Redis for my caching implementation on bbxp (which I hadn't reinstituted since migrating to Core).  I hope to complete this implementation over the weekend.
